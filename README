* Rails 3:   rails plugin install git@github.com:palladius/ric_addons.git

To take advantage of it (until I dont understand how it works u have to manually symlink, sigh!)

- copy the layout from vendor/plugins/ric_addons/lib/app/views/layout/application.html.erb
- ln -s:  app/views/ric_addons/ to vendor/plugins/ric_addons/lib/app/views/ric_addons/

* application_controller.rb:

 include Searchable
